# 🐾 Pet-sonality Profiler
[![Launch App](https://img.shields.io/badge/Try_it-Here-blue)](https://petsonality.netlify.app/)

**Pet-sonality Profiler** is a lightweight web app that explores the curious relationship between people and their pets.

It combines humor with robust scientific investigation generalizing psychology-inspired patterns, and evidence-based insights from animal-assisted therapy research to:

- reveal personality traits linked to preferred pets,
- suggest an ideal companion if you don’t have one,
- recommend therapeutic animals based on selected health conditions.

This project is intentionally non-diagnostic, but thoughtfully grounded in real scientific literature.
Every suggestion and recommendations are scientifically driven and substantiated.

## ✨ Features

### 🐶 Pet-sonality Profile
Select a pet (and breed, when applicable) to generate a playful (but still non-fictional and scientifically substantiated!) psychological profile, including:

- dominant personality traits,
- strengths and weaknesses,
- social and romantic tendencies,
- humorous but relatable insights.

Every time you look for a new profile, pay attention to the proverbs and jokes - they contain the wisdom of the ages!

### 🧠 “Still Have No Pet?” Quiz
A short interactive quiz that:

- analyzes personal preferences and lifestyle,
- visualizes compatibility scores for different pets,
- suggests the best and worst pet matches dynamically.

### 🩺 Pet Therapy Assistant
A tool, inspired by recent scientific evidence, that:

- maps selected mental or physical conditions to animals used in therapy,
- ranks pets by relative supportive benefit,
- emphasizes supportive—not curative—effects.
